```{bash}
quarto pandoc --version 2>&1 | head -3
```

## Instalation

To use the `mkgallery` extension in your Quarto project, run this command in the terminal from the project's working directory.
This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory.

```bash
quarto add t-arae/mkgallery
```

Then, apply the `blogcard` filter by adding the following lines to the YAML header of your `.qmd` file.

```yaml
filters:
  - t-arae/mkgallery
```

## Using

To create a card using the `mkgallery` shortcode, write the shortcode directive like this:

```markdown
{{{< mkgallery articles/imgs >}}}
```
